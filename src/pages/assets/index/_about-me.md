I specialize in building stable and iterative cloud-based services, primarily using the **Java** technology stack. With solid expertise in **microservices** design and development, I possess in-depth knowledge of **cloud-native architectures** and am proficient in container orchestration technologies like **Kubernetes** for automated service deployment and operations.

I am also proficient in using **Django** for rapid service construction, particularly effective for prototyping and data management solutions. On the frontend, I regularly employ **TypeScript** with **React.js** for development. Rather than being confined to specific technologies, I prioritize selecting optimal solutions based on practical requirements. Passionate about **open-source** and **cloud-native** technologies, I maintain a commitment to continuously learning and applying cutting-edge technical concepts in real-world scenarios.
